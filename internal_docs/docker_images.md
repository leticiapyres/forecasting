## Available Docker Images

We recommend to use Docker images for the reproduciblility of the submissions. For each problem, we provide a basic Docker image to speed up the process of new benchmark implementation. This image contains basic configurations of the system and few commonly used packages. We store the basic Docker images in Azure Container Registry (ACR). One can directly use the basic image by pulling it from the ACR or modify it for their own benchmark implementations. Under each example submission folder, there are a Dockerfile and requirements.txt file used for creating the basic image. The Dockerfile contains the main configuration steps and requirements.txt includes the necessary Python packages. By modifying these files, one can easily create their own Docker images and host them in ACR or other venues such as Docker Hub.
