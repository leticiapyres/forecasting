## Available Docker Images

We recommend to use Docker images for the reproduciblility of the submissions. In TSPerf, we provide a basic Docker image to speed up the process of new benchmark implementation, namely tsperf.azurecr.io/common/image:v1 in tsperf Azure Container Registry (ACR). This image contains basic configurations of the system and a few commonly used packages. One can directly use the basic image by pulling it from the ACR or modify it for their own benchmark implementations. 

Under `/TSPerf/common` folder, there are a Dockerfile and requirements.txt file used for creating the basic image. The Dockerfile contains the main configuration steps and requirements.txt includes the necessary Python packages. By modifying these files, one can easily create their own Docker images and host them in ACR or other venues such as Docker Hub.
